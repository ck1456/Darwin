The attached zip file contains all of the source and compiled code to produce solutions

Copy the zip file to an energon machine and unzip:
> unzip GenMat.zip
> cd GenMat

The GenMat.jar in this directory is the tool used to generate solutions.
You can invoke it with three command line arguments <problem_type> <input> <output>:
> java -jar GenMat.jar A input_darwin.txt output_darwin.txt

If necessary you can rebuild the jar file by using the included ant build script:
> ant clean
> ant
